## Data Structures And Algorithms

As an Aerospace Engineering student, I'm not taught much about software and how to solve complex problems using software efficiently. Because of this, I thought I'd learn the basics of Data Structures and Algorithms, because I think it'd contribute to my ability to use computer science/software engineering to solve aerospace problems in the future.
