## Data Structures And Algorithms

As an Aerospace Engineering student, I'm not taught much about software and how to solve complex problems using software efficiently. Because of this, I thought I'd learn the basics of Data Structures and Algorithms, because I think it'd contribute to my ability to use computer science/software engineering to solve aerospace problems in the future.

I think this is one the first steps in my journey. In the future, I hope to investigate a lot more about software, such as systems design and development, robotics as well as AI.

# Types of Data Structures
1. Linear Data Structures
2. Non-Linear Data Structures

# Linear Data Structures
1. Array Data Structure
2. Stack Data Structure
3. Queue Data Structure
4. Linked List Data Structure

# Non-Linear Data Structures
1. Graph Data Structure (Many types)
2. Trees Data Structure (Many types)

# Linear vs Non-Linear Data Structures
Linear Data Structures are arranged in sequential order one after another, in which you can traverse through the array in a single run. The memory utilisation is not as efficient as Non-Linear Data Structures and has a increasing time complexity as the size of the array grows.

Non-Linear Data Structures are not arranged in non-sequential order (hirearchical structure) often containing multiple layers. It might not be possible to traverse through all the elements in the data structure in a single pass, because of the difference between layers. Different data structures utilise memory in different efficient ways (compared to linear data structures) as time complexity is independent of data structure size.
